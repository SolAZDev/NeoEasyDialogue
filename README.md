# NeoEasyDialogue
A Fork of Sander Homan's EasyDialogue, updated for Unity 2017 with JSON support

### Why Fork it?
Sander Homan's work hasn't been updated since 2015, some of his work was already forked. This was forked to use JSON instead of XML, in hopes that the files can be used, and imported from elsewhere, amongst other things.

### Uses
You need to implement the actual dialogue "viewer" in UI or however else you want, you are not limited to UI, so you can do pretty much anything with it. An example would be an exam that would use collissions as a way of selecting a choice.

The Dialogue "Entries" have a dedicated custom string called "userData" this can be used as arguments to do many things (exmple being SolAZDev's [Basic Dialuge Manager](https://github.com/SolAZDev/BasicDialogueManager "Basic Dialogue Manager") which can be used for Cutscenes with arguments)
